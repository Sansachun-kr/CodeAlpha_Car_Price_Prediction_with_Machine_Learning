# üöò Car Price Prediction with Machine Learning
This project demonstrates how machine learning can be used to predict the **market price of used cars** based on various car-related features. It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, regression modeling, and result evaluation ‚Äî all using Python.

# Project Overview
Predicting used car prices is a common problem in the automotive and resale industries. This project uses a regression approach to estimate the price of a car based on its specifications, usage, and brand-related features.

# Objective
- Collect and analyze car-related data including brand, year, mileage, fuel type, transmission, and more.
- Train a regression model to predict the **actual car price**.
- Handle missing values, encode categorical features, and perform feature engineering.
- Visualize relationships between variables and car price.
- Evaluate the trained model using appropriate regression metrics.

# Dataset
- **File**: `car.csv`
- **Key Features**:
  - `Car_Name` ‚Äì Name of the car
  - `Year` ‚Äì Year of manufacture
  - `Present_Price` ‚Äì Price when new
  - `Kms_Driven` ‚Äì Distance the car has traveled
  - `Fuel_Type` ‚Äì Type of fuel used
  - `Seller_Type` ‚Äì Dealer or Individual
  - `Transmission` ‚Äì Manual or Automatic
  - `Owner` ‚Äì Number of previous owners
- **Target Variable**: **Predicted Car Price**

# Technologies & Libraries Used
- Python  
- pandas  
- numpy  
- seaborn  
- matplotlib  
- scikit-learn  

# ML Workflow
1. **Data Collection**  
   Load car dataset with relevant attributes affecting car pricing.
2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handle missing values and duplicates  
   - Convert categorical features using encoding  
   - Format numerical and date fields
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**  
   - Plot distributions and correlations  
   - Visualize fuel type, transmission, and year effects on price
4. **Model Training**  
   - Train regression models like **Linear Regression** or **Random Forest Regressor**  
   - Evaluate using **R¬≤ score**, **MAE**, **RMSE**
5. **Price Prediction**  
   Use the trained model to predict prices of unseen or user-input cars.

# How to Run the Project
1. Open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
2. Upload the following:
   - `CodeAlpha_Task3_Car_Price_Prediction_Project.ipynb`
   - `car.csv` dataset
3. Click on **Runtime > Run all**
4. The notebook will output:
   - Cleaned data preview
   - Visualizations
   - Trained model results
   - Predicted car prices

# Real-World Relevance
This type of ML model is used by:
- Used car marketplaces
- Dealership software platforms
- Car loan and insurance providers
It shows how data-driven decision-making can improve **pricing transparency** and **sales efficiency**.
